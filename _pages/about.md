I am a fifth-year Ph.D. scholar at the IIT Madras advised by [Prof. B. Ravindran](https://dsai.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and [Prof. Nirav P. Bhatt](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=b6dXpnAAAAAJ). My research works focus on learning safe policies by infering safety from non-preferred (unsafe) demonstrations. I am broadly intersted in Reinforcement Learning and its application to robotics. I am also interested in building safe robotic systems that can generalize across multiple tasks communicated via natural language or visual cues, in unseen environments. 

Experience
======
I graduated in 2016 from IIT Hyderabad with a degree in Electrical Engineering. During my undergrad I did research at the multiple target tracking and communication engineering. I was also the Robotics Coordinator and had participated in multiple robotics competitions.  

After graduating I worked for a 4 years at Yahoo! Japan as a Software Engineer. At Yahoo Japan, I was fortunate to work on various topics on big data science and text classification. 

During my Ph.D. I’ve worked at:
* Google as a Student Researcher with [Dr. Anirban Santara](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x9ly9Q0AAAAJ) and [Dr. Gaurav Aggarwal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauagg/) on Imitation Learning.
* Visited University of Tokyo as Sakura Science Intern, [Prof. Kawashima's Lab](http://www.bmc.ipc.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.html)
