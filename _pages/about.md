Previously I was working as a Software Engineer at Yahoo! Japan, Tokyo. At Yahoo Japan, I was fortunate to work on various topics on big data science and text classification. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at IIT Hyderabad. I did my bachelor's project on multiple target tracking.

Currently I am trying to understand the fundamentals of reinforcement learning. 

If you are also interested in reinforcement learning or multi-agents collaboration or robotics, I would be really happy to work with you!!
