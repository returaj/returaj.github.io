Previously I was working as a Software Engineer at Yahoo! Japan, Tokyo. At Yahoo Japan, I was fortunate to work on various topics on big data science and text classification. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at IIT Hyderabad. I was mentored by [Prof. Soumya Jana](https://iith.ac.in/~jana/#) for my bachelor's project on multiple target tracking.

Currently I am focusing on how multi-agents can collaborate to complete a task. 

If you are also interested in multi-agents collaboration, I would be really happy to work with you!!
